Setup : Mitmproxy
Bypassing SSL Pinning via MITM
Some applications traffic can not be captured via burp suite directly in such cases MITM comes into the picture. Instead of capturing the traffic via burp suite, we can use MITM to capture traffic and then send it to the burp suite using MITM. MITM can also be used with the objection, Frida script, and other tools.It works many times, in one of my projects I tried a lot to bypass SSL pinning but nothing worked then at the end with one Frida script and MITM, I was able to capture the traffic.

1.Install mitmproxy via the following command in MacBook
brew install mitmproxy

2. Download the MITM certificate in the android phone > set proxy use a proxy server : http://localhost:8081

3. Connect the device and Macbook via USB and Enter the below command or set the proxy in android device

mitmproxy


4. Enter the below command in the android device browser

Mitm.it (Download the Android certificate)


5. Install the MITM certificate on the android phone

In android phone navigate to Setting => Install from device storage=> CA Certificate => install

6. Enter the below command to start the mitmproxy in the Browser.

mitmweb (mitm get open in the browser automatically)


7. Setup MITMProxy for forwarding traffic from the MITM to the burp suite.

8. Enter the below command

mitmweb
command to change port : mitmweb --listen-port 8081

9. Go to the option and click on “Edit Options” and click on “set this configuration”


10. Search for mode and add the following line there

upstream:http://127.0.0.1:8888


11. Search for ssl_insecure and enable it


12. Set proxy in burp suite.

Set the IP address and port no in the burp suite which you have set for the upstream in mode option.

13. Start browsing the application from android phone and observe that the traffic will be captured in the burp suite.

Remark *** set port on burp suite to : all interface : 8888
